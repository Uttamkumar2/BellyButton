# Overview : From Bacteria to Beef.

Roza is biological researcher in a prominent microbiology lab, many bacterial species are not well studies and many more are unknown to science, Roza’s role is to discover and document these bacteria.
Roza interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize protein that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered food startup to research candidate species.
Lab has successfully synthesized meat from various plants, fungus and micro-organism that have found in plant roots, however beef still searching for illusive bacteria that can provide perfect beef like taste.
Roza has hypothesis that there is a micro-organism close to home, that can provide next best taste. Roza believe that the human body can be Provide thousands of sources of bacterial from different part of the human body. Roza hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in human Bellies or at least in someone’s belly buttons.
To test her hypothesis Roza has samples the navels of ppl across the country to identify bacterial species to colonize the belly buttons, each people identify is amomums and they have replaced by ID number.
Roza wants to build the dashboard that both research participants, and fellow researcher, can access by select their id number to see which bacterial species live in their navel. who know what they might find.

## Resources

As the objective of providing this dashboard is to identify the best way to share information to her audiences, this is complete case of data visualization. biggest advantage of Data Visualization using JavaScript, is we can debug and develop at the same time. and best part is, it’s not required to install any software. There are various library like Plotly, D3 available in JavaScript  to generate best data Visualization graphs like bar graph, which helps to visualize an individual that number of bacterial species in their body, bubble graph show's that bacteria culture in human body per sample or even gauge graph to identify frequency of weekly washing their belly buttons.
